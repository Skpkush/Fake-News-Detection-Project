# Fake-News-Detection-Project


**Project Description for Fake News Detection**
Project Title: Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

Overview: This project addresses the growing concern of misinformation by developing a machine learning-based system to detect fake news articles. By analyzing features such as the article's title, author, and content, the system classifies news articles as either real or fake, providing a timely solution to combat the spread of false information.

Objective: The main goal is to create a predictive model that leverages historical news data to accurately assess the authenticity of articles. The model evaluates various factors, including linguistic patterns and contextual relevance, to minimize risks for readers and media platforms.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values and merging relevant fields.
Text Processing: Implementing stemming and removing stopwords to standardize the text data.
Predictive Modeling: Using classification algorithms, particularly Logistic Regression, to categorize articles.
Model Evaluation: Measuring performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
User Interface: Providing an interface for users to input article details and receive instant feedback on its credibility.
Results: The model achieved a training accuracy of 98.66% and a test accuracy of 97.91%, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between real and fake news.
